Description:
    Calculates the size of the capacitor and resistor to 
    ensure the cutoff frequency is meant and the rise time
    isn't too slow.
    
    Time constant -> R & C proportionally
    Cutoff frequency -> 1/R & 1/C
    Hence fixed R (reduces voltage drop), dynamic Cap
    
    NOTE:
    This script does use my custom framework picounits.
