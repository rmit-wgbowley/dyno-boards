Filename: dyno_rpm_scale.py

Description:
    Calculates the dyno rpm scale for the A13 input which is
    0-10V analog with a discretization of 5mV per rpm.

    The dyno (AI1 & AI2) inputs have impedances of 200kOhm 
    and sampling of 3.3ms.
    
    NOTE:
    This script does use my custom framework picounits

    NOTE:
    The current test load is a 8 pole fischer PMSM with a
    planetary gearbox of with a 1:12.81. Hence this analytical
    analysis will be using that ratio.

    NOTE:
    The input signal is 10kHz hence with the current RC filter
    before the 2x op-amp. ~1.6uF & 2kOhms with a pre-amplification
    ripple of ~78.5mV & time-constant of 3.183ms
    
    NOTE:
    The AI1 Input is modelled as a RC filter with a time constant of 
    3.3ms hence the total attenuation is first_order (rc filter) *
    second_order (AI1 input). THIS IS AN ASSUMPTION. NOT VALIDATED.
    
    Validate:
    RC filter attenuation (first order)
    Assumed:
    AI1 attenuation (second order)
